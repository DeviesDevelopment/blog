&lt;p>The purpose of this action is to make the developer aware of when feedbacks loops get longer. Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you are running unit tests as part of your current workflow. If merging your changes (your PR) would increase the time it takes to run the unit tests by 50%, your changes probably have unwanted side effects. It&amp;rsquo;s about creating awareness for the developer.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
