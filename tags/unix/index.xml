I spent most of the time figuring out why a library did not accept my freshly generated RSA private key. I was supposed to provide the RSA private key as an environment variable RSA_PRIVATE_KEY. I wanted to store the RSA private key in a file private-key.pem so my first attempt became RSA_PRIVATE_KEY=\&amp;quot;$(cat private-key.pem)\&amp;quot; docker-compose up -d, which failed due to decoding issues by the library.</description></item></channel></rss>
