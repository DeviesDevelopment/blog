TypeScript is already a great upgrade from JavaScript if you like types and want to ensure type-safety in your code base. Zod aids that goal by making sure that incoming data satisfies the purpose it is about to fulfill, among other features of course.
Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library with lots of features that I have yet to use. However, the basics are very handy and simple to get started with!</description></item></channel></rss>
