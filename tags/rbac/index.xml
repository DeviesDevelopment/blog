All external configuration used by the application is stored in an Azure App Configuration store. I recently updated how the application authenticates toward the App Configuration store and think it worked out pretty well.
Prior to the change we used connection strings (i.e. a string containing endpoint, username and password) for authentication. The main drawback with this is that we have to manage the credentials ourselves.</description></item></channel></rss>
