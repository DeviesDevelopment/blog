We love to share our knowledge and improve each other That is why we have this series of presentations in the office about office ergonomics. Yes series, this is just the beginning, a general introduction to the topic. So this is a summary of the initial presentation. Later we will have more specific examples.
Who are you to tell me what to do I am not telling you what to do but recommend ways to keep your joints and bones and muscles healthy, based on a lot of research and my own experience.</description></item></channel></rss>
