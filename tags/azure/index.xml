Background Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines are great tools to automate the deployment process of a software. Their main objective is to minimise human error and maintain a consistent process for how the software is released.
For Xcode projects this becomes a time critical process once the project has to be built for different configurations and/or environments. Since every configuration might require a different signing method, or even different deployment platform.</description></item><item><title>We Got Cached ðŸ˜±</title><link>https://deviesdevelopment.github.io/blog/posts/we-got-cached/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 13:29:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://deviesdevelopment.github.io/blog/posts/we-got-cached/</guid><description>For the past couple of weeks, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a React app from scratch. Additionally, we&amp;rsquo;ve added pipelines in Azure as an attempt to achieve MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY when it comes to deployment and integration. So there we are. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely morning. The sun is shining, the coffee is warm, and we&amp;rsquo;re ready to drop some lines of code! ðŸ˜Ž
Last week we built and deployed a version of our React app that had a slightly faulty CSS attribute that made the header of the app take up the whole screen.</description></item><item><title>Using managed identities and role based access control is great!</title><link>https://deviesdevelopment.github.io/blog/posts/managed-identities-and-rbac-is-great/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 20:15:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://deviesdevelopment.github.io/blog/posts/managed-identities-and-rbac-is-great/</guid><description>In a project I work with we use Azure App Service for hosting an ASP.NET application. All external configuration used by the application is stored in an Azure App Configuration store. I recently updated how the application authenticates toward the App Configuration store and think it worked out pretty well.
Prior to the change we used connection strings (i.e. a string containing endpoint, username and password) for authentication. The main drawback with this is that we have to manage the credentials ourselves.</description></item></channel></rss>
