It is much more common to use a library like Lit or Stencil. The library helps with registration of the web component and change management as well as interoperability with popular frameworks.
In our case, in addition to Lit and Stencil, we also considered Mitosis, and compiling to web components with Solid or Angular.</p></div><a href=/posts/how-we-chose-to-implement-our-design-system-with-web-components/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/implementing-a-design-system-choosing-a-way-forward/ class="link black dim">Implementing a design system - Choosing a way forward</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p>For the last year one of my main projects at work has been to lead the implementation of a design system, building it together with my team.

You instantly start to chase new ideas, while forgetting about prior (and possibly important) ideas.
It might be hard to determine when you&rsquo;re done.
You might not commit intermediary working states, and have a hard time finding what you&rsquo;ve messed up once something is broken.</p></div><a href=/posts/a-structured-approach-to-work-with-software-development-tasks/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/tags/swagger/ class="link blue hover-black">Tag: Swagger</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/creating-a-postman-collection-from-swagger/ class="link black dim">Creating a Postman Collection From Swagger</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><h1 id=background>Background</h1><p>This is probably not news to anyone that has been working as developer consultant.

I spent most of the time figuring out why a library did not accept my freshly generated RSA private key.
I was supposed to provide the RSA private key as an environment variable <code>RSA_PRIVATE_KEY</code>. I wanted to store the RSA private key in a file <code>private-key.pem</code> so my first attempt became <code>RSA_PRIVATE_KEY=\"$(cat private-key.pem)\" docker-compose up -d</code>, which failed due to decoding issues by the library.
It would appear that the library was very strict on the format of the private key.
After a lot of debugging, I managed to figure out how I was supposed to provide the private key and I will try to share my learnings here.</p></div><a href=/posts/learn-the-tools-in-the-toolbox/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/tags/custom-script/ class="link blue hover-black">Tag: Custom-Script</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/how-xcode-bamboozled-me/ class="link black dim">How Xcode Bamboozled Me</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p>A common dilemma within the field of software development is traversing too deep within documentation to discover the solution to a bug.

During some periods I haven&rsquo;t bothered, and that&rsquo;s OK.
I can always write a new entry tomorrow, or next week.</p><p>The diary can cover a lot of different aspects from your daily work.
Below are some examples.</p><ul><li>Things you&rsquo;ve learned</li><li>Accomplishments that you&rsquo;re proud of</li><li>Thoughts on dynamics within your team</li><li>Sketches of ideas</li><li>Reasoning behind technical decisions</li><li>Solutions to problems that you&rsquo;ve struggled with</li></ul><p>I think the greatest benefit of writing a diary is that you give yourself time to reflect on your daily work.
You will think about things that works less well and identify improvements for both yourself and your team.
Sometimes we feel that we&rsquo;re just standing still, not developing as individuals.
By reflecting on accomplishments and things you&rsquo;ve learned you can more clearly see that you&rsquo;re actually growing as an individual, every day.
You might reflect a lot already without writing anything about it.
That&rsquo;s great, but your brain might not be the most suitable storage solution in the long-term.
Additionally, when writing thoughts or solutions related to different problems, you&rsquo;ll get a personal knowledge base.

During some periods I haven&rsquo;t bothered, and that&rsquo;s OK.
I can always write a new entry tomorrow, or next week.</p><p>The diary can cover a lot of different aspects from your daily work.
Below are some examples.</p><ul><li>Things you&rsquo;ve learned</li><li>Accomplishments that you&rsquo;re proud of</li><li>Thoughts on dynamics within your team</li><li>Sketches of ideas</li><li>Reasoning behind technical decisions</li><li>Solutions to problems that you&rsquo;ve struggled with</li></ul><p>I think the greatest benefit of writing a diary is that you give yourself time to reflect on your daily work.
You will think about things that works less well and identify improvements for both yourself and your team.
Sometimes we feel that we&rsquo;re just standing still, not developing as individuals.
By reflecting on accomplishments and things you&rsquo;ve learned you can more clearly see that you&rsquo;re actually growing as an individual, every day.
You might reflect a lot already without writing anything about it.
That&rsquo;s great, but your brain might not be the most suitable storage solution in the long-term.
Additionally, when writing thoughts or solutions related to different problems, you&rsquo;ll get a personal knowledge base.

The short feedback loop, namely, the time and effort it takes to get feedback for your changes. Enable hot or live reloading while developing, and the results of your changes will be in front of you instantly, which is super nice. This is how it should be, even when you are developing the backend, infrastructure, CI/CD, or whatever. A long feedback loop can have a lot of hidden consequences, and it makes you ineffective. You and your team should spend time making sure that your feedback loop is short, and kept short.</p></div><a href=/posts/2022-02-22-long-feedback-loops-invite-for-context-switching/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/tags/ansible/ class="link blue hover-black">Tag: Ansible</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/automated-ec2-setup/ class="link black dim">How I've automated the setup of my virtual server</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been looking for a good way of hosting some personal projects.
