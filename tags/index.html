In this post, I will discuss some different tricks you can use to minimize these cold start times.
The problem with cold starts arises when there are no &ldquo;warm&rdquo; lambda available to handle an incoming request, which usually happens whenever an endpoint experiences a large and sudden spike in traffic.</div></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/blog/tags/kubernetes class="link blue hover-black">Tag: kubernetes</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/a-tip-for-improving-the-terminal-experience-when-working-with-git-and-kubernetes/ class="link black dim">Better Terminal Experience for Git and Kubernetes</a></h1><time class="f6 mv2 dib tracked" datetime=2022-05-11T21:04:31+02:00>May 11, 2022</time><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When working on a project that uses git, it is essential to checkout the correct branch.

The short feedback loop, namely, the time and effort it takes to get feedback for your changes. Enable hot or live reloading while developing, and the results of your changes will be in front of you instantly, which is super nice. This is how it should be, even when you are developing the backend, infrastructure, CI/CD, or whatever.</div></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/blog/tags/nginx class="link blue hover-black">Tag: nginx</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/introducing-frontman/ class="link black dim">Introducing Frontman</a></h1><time class="f6 mv2 dib tracked" datetime=2022-01-28T10:08:32+02:00>January 28, 2022</time><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Frontman is a very light-weight NGINX reverse proxy that is deployed using Docker. Its purpose is to act as the entry point to your server. It will redirect incoming traffic to one out of many Docker-based applications running on the same server, based on the hostname in the incoming request.
The rationale behind this is that it enables you to host as many services as you want on the same server, while still only keeping ports 80 and 443 open to the outside world.</div></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/blog/tags/pipeline class="link blue hover-black">Tag: pipeline</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/we-got-cached/ class="link black dim">We Got Cached 😱</a></h1><time class="f6 mv2 dib tracked" datetime=2022-05-13T13:29:31+02:00>May 13, 2022</time><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">For the past couple of weeks, we&rsquo;ve been working on a React app from scratch.

The sun is shining, the coffee is warm, and we&rsquo;re ready to drop some lines of code! 😎
Last week we built and deployed a version of our React app that had a slightly faulty CSS attribute that made the header of the app take up the whole screen.</div></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/blog/tags/python class="link blue hover-black">Tag: python</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/aws-timestream/ class="link black dim">Trying out AWS Timestream</a></h1><time class="f6 mv2 dib tracked" datetime=2021-12-22T15:50:15+01:00>December 22, 2021</time><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">AWS recently (last year) released their new server-less database focused purely on time series data, Amazon Timestream.

Prior to the change we used connection strings (i.e. a string containing endpoint, username and password) for authentication. The main drawback with this is that we have to manage the credentials ourselves.</div></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/blog/tags/terminal class="link blue hover-black">Tag: terminal</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/a-tip-for-improving-the-terminal-experience-when-working-with-git-and-kubernetes/ class="link black dim">Better Terminal Experience for Git and Kubernetes</a></h1><time class="f6 mv2 dib tracked" datetime=2022-05-11T21:04:31+02:00>May 11, 2022</time><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When working on a project that uses git, it is essential to checkout the correct branch.
