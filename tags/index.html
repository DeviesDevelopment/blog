This struggle can be represented and reflected in many aspects of life, however as developers we encounter this dilemma more often than not.
This post is about how I fell into this dilemma and got bamboozled by Apple&rsquo;s integrated development environment, Xcode.</p><p>It&rsquo;s ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning and I&rsquo;ve just configured and bumped the dependencies for my client&rsquo;s android application which they hadn&rsquo;t touched for over two years.
Everything looked decent and worked properly.
I was now ready to further develop their iOS application which also hadn&rsquo;t been developed on since early 2020.

So there we are. It&rsquo;s a lovely morning. The sun is shining, the coffee is warm, and we&rsquo;re ready to drop some lines of code! 😎</p><p>Last week we built and deployed a version of our React app that had a slightly faulty CSS attribute that made the header of the app take up the whole screen. Thus our first and foremost task was to fix it so that it only takes up a small area at the top of the screen. We used the Inspection feature in Firefox Developer Edition to pinpoint the faulty CSS and determine the issue, which we managed to do. The next step was to apply that fix in our code to see what would happen. The fix worked locally by running the React app using <code>yarn start</code> as well as deploying a Docker image. Great, the fix is ready to be deployed using our Azure pipelines!</p></div><a href=/posts/we-got-cached/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/managed-identities-and-rbac-is-great/ class="link black dim">Using managed identities and role based access control is great!</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p>In a project I work with we use <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview>Azure App Service</a> for hosting an ASP.NET application.

I recently updated how the application authenticates toward the App Configuration store and think it worked out pretty well.</p><p>Prior to the change we used connection strings (i.e. a string containing endpoint, username and password) for authentication. The main drawback with this is that we have to manage the credentials ourselves. We must provide the connection string to the application in some way (e.g. set it in a CI/CD pipeline after deploying our application). If our connection string is compromised, we must regenerate it and make sure that the application is provided with the new one.</p></div><a href=/posts/managed-identities-and-rbac-is-great/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/tags/ios/ class="link blue hover-black">Tag: IOS</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/xcode-14-manual-signing/ class="link black dim">Xcode 14 & SPM: Deployment Pipeline in Azure</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p><em><a href=#tldr>tl;dr</a></em></p><h2 id=background>Background</h2><p>Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines are great tools to automate the deployment process of a software.

Additionally, we&rsquo;ve added pipelines in Azure as an attempt to achieve <span style=font-family:Arial;color:#00c0ff>MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY</span> when it comes to deployment and integration. So there we are. It&rsquo;s a lovely morning. The sun is shining, the coffee is warm, and we&rsquo;re ready to drop some lines of code! 😎</p><p>Last week we built and deployed a version of our React app that had a slightly faulty CSS attribute that made the header of the app take up the whole screen. Thus our first and foremost task was to fix it so that it only takes up a small area at the top of the screen. We used the Inspection feature in Firefox Developer Edition to pinpoint the faulty CSS and determine the issue, which we managed to do. The next step was to apply that fix in our code to see what would happen. The fix worked locally by running the React app using <code>yarn start</code> as well as deploying a Docker image. Great, the fix is ready to be deployed using our Azure pipelines!</p></div><a href=/posts/we-got-cached/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/tags/spm/ class="link blue hover-black">Tag: SPM</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/xcode-14-manual-signing/ class="link black dim">Xcode 14 & SPM: Deployment Pipeline in Azure</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p><em><a href=#tldr>tl;dr</a></em></p><h2 id=background>Background</h2><p>Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines are great tools to automate the deployment process of a software.

I spent most of the time figuring out why a library did not accept my freshly generated RSA private key.
I was supposed to provide the RSA private key as an environment variable <code>RSA_PRIVATE_KEY</code>. I wanted to store the RSA private key in a file <code>private-key.pem</code> so my first attempt became <code>RSA_PRIVATE_KEY=\"$(cat private-key.pem)\" docker-compose up -d</code>, which failed due to decoding issues by the library.
It would appear that the library was very strict on the format of the private key.
After a lot of debugging, I managed to figure out how I was supposed to provide the private key and I will try to share my learnings here.</p></div><a href=/posts/learn-the-tools-in-the-toolbox/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/tags/custom-script/ class="link blue hover-black">Tag: Custom-Script</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/how-xcode-bamboozled-me/ class="link black dim">How Xcode Bamboozled Me</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p>A common dilemma within the field of software development is traversing too deep within documentation to discover the solution to a bug.

Thus our first and foremost task was to fix it so that it only takes up a small area at the top of the screen. We used the Inspection feature in Firefox Developer Edition to pinpoint the faulty CSS and determine the issue, which we managed to do. The next step was to apply that fix in our code to see what would happen. The fix worked locally by running the React app using <code>yarn start</code> as well as deploying a Docker image.
