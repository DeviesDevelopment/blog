Prior to the change we used connection strings (i.e. a string containing endpoint, username and password) for authentication.

Since every configuration might require a different signing method, or even different deployment platform.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/how-xcode-bamboozled-me/ class="link black dim">How Xcode Bamboozled Me</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A common dilemma within the field of software development is traversing too deep within documentation to discover the solution to a bug.

&ldquo;Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, and serverless time series database service for IoT and operational applications that makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of events per day up to 1,000 times faster and at as little as 1/10th the cost of relational databases.</div></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/blog/tags/java/ class="link blue hover-black">Tag: Java</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/implementation/aws/2021/04/08/minimize-java-lambda-coldstarts.html/ class="link black dim">Minimize Java Lambda Cold Start Times</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">If you have ever run Java inside a lambda function on AWS, you will have noticed the quite significant cold start times that comes with spinning up the JVM environment. In this post, I will discuss some different tricks you can use to minimize these cold start times.
The problem with cold starts arises when there are no &ldquo;warm&rdquo; lambda available to handle an incoming request, which usually happens whenever an endpoint experiences a large and sudden spike in traffic.</div></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/blog/tags/dynamodb/ class="link blue hover-black">Tag: DynamoDB</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/2021-03-30-dynamodb-migrations/ class="link black dim">Migrating data between DynamoDB tables</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When setting up a new DynamoDB table, an important decision is to decide what primary key to use. However, it’s not uncommon to not have the full picture up front and therefore it could be hard to make the right decision beforehand. While the official AWS documentation states that “you shouldn’t start designing your schema for DynamoDB until you know the questions it will need to answer”, you often need to experiment to be able to discover what those questions are.</div></div></div></section></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4
