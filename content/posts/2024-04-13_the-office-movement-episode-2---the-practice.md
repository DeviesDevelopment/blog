After the first session we gathered some requests, made some FMS tests.
The results were quite aligned with the general average.
So now lets see some exercises which can affect most of them.
At the same time these exercises are easy to do and they can fit simply in an office environment.

Lets start from the center as "all roads lead to Rome".
It is a common trend that the glutes are not utilized enough.
You may have heard from a trainer in a gym to activate your glutes.
But what does that mean?
In layman terms, imagine you need to hold a piece of paper between your buttcheeks.
You need to squeeze it for that, so basically that is it.
Doing so what do you notice?
1. it reduces the curve in your lover back
1. rotates your femur (thighs) out
1. as well as your knees
1. which can rotate your ankles in the same direction helping the arch of your feet

The first point is because the pelvis can be tilted forward and this activation tilts it back closer to horizontal.
Having other good side effects around the abdomen.
We can't cover all details here, but you can [drop us a message and become a devie](https://www.devies.se/become-a-devie/) and join us in the office if you are interested.

Do you need to do this all the time?
Walking everwhere like you messed up your pants?
Of course not, and you don't need to squeeze it 110% percent so you look like having diarrhea.
It does not have to be visible from the outside.
You can go full force but you don't have to.
You can variate longer period with less effort and shorter with full squeeze.

It is about developing a habit.
You may already have some reminders set up, to stop staring at your screen and rest your eyes for a minute.
Or to drink some time to time.
You can add one more to remember activating your glutes every now and then.

An other way is to pick some recurring activities where you do it.
For example "i walk up the stairs to the office with my glutes mostly engaged".
