At Devies we run a book club where we on a weekly basis discuss topics from a book that we are reading in a common pace.
Right now, we are reading [The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/).
In this post, we'll share learnings around some of the topics we have discussed.

# A Pragmatic Philosophy

Everything seems obvious, but not non-trivial to apply in daily work?
 - The cat at my source code
    - How to take responsibility for your project?
    - Be honest and show your mistakes! Focus on learning from them
 - Good enough software
    - Scope of what is "good enough" is growing, POs responsibility is to make sure it's growing at a reasonable pace?

# A Pragmatic Approach

 - ETC, foundation of everything
 - Tracer bullets vs Prototypes

# The Basic Tools

One of the topics discussed in this chapter is the importance of using a version control system, e.g. git.
At first, this might seem like an obvious advice.
What we realized is that the chapter emphasises that *everything* should be version controlled.

 - Wiki
 - Terraform (converting manual processes into version controlled text files)
 - Architecture diagrams, etc (mermaid)

# Pragmatic Paranoia

 - Crasch early
 - Don't outrun your headlights
 - Defend code from yourself?
