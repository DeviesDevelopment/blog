At Devies we run a book club where we on a weekly basis discuss topics from a book that we are reading in a common pace.
Right now, we are reading [The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/).
In this post, we'll share learnings around some of the topics we have discussed.

# A Pragmatic Philosophy

# A Pragmatic Approach

# The Basic Tools

One of the topics discussed in this chapter is the importance of using a version control system, e.g. git.
At first, this might seem like an obvious advice.
What we realized is that the chapter emphasises that *everything* should be version controlled.

 - Wiki
 - Terraform (converting manual processes into version controlled text files)
 - Architecture diagrams, etc (mermaid)

# Pragmatic Paranoia
