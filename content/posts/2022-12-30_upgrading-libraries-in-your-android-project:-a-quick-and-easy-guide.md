## Hey fellow developers!

Upgrading libraries in your gradle file for an Android project is a crucial part of keeping your project up to date and running smoothly.
However, it's not uncommon to encounter errors or deprecated code after upgrading a library. If this happens to you, don't panic!
There are a few steps you can take to fix the issues and get your project back on track.

## Step 1: Open Your Project's build.gradle File

The build.gradle file is located in the root directory of your project and defines all of the dependencies and libraries that your project uses.
To upgrade a library, you'll need to make changes to this file.

## Step 2: Look for Outdated Libraries

In the dependencies block of the build.gradle file, look for any dependencies that are out of date or that you want to upgrade.
For example, let's say you want to upgrade the appcompat-v7 library from version 27.1.1 to version 30.0.0.
To do this, you would change the following line:

```gradle
implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:27.1.1'
```

to:

```gradle
implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:30.0.0'
```

## Step 3: Sync Your Project with the New Gradle File

After making changes to your build.gradle file, you'll need to sync your project with the new gradle file.
To do this, go to the "Project" pane in Android Studio and click the "Refresh" button, or use the ./gradlew build command if you're using the command line.
First, try to understand the error message or warning that you are seeing.
This will often give you a good indication of what the problem is and how to fix it.
If you're not sure what the message means, you can try searching online for more information or seeking help from your fellow colleagues at the office or through slack.

## Step 4: Fix Any Errors or Deprecated Code

Once you have a better understanding of the problem, you can start working on a solution.
This may involve updating your code to use new features or APIs that are available in the newer version of the library, or it may involve changing your code to avoid using deprecated features or APIs.

If you're having trouble figuring out how to fix the issues, you may want to consider downgrading to an earlier version of the library.
This can be a good option if you don't want to spend a lot of time fixing issues or if you need to get your project up and running as quickly as possible, MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

To downgrade a library, simply change the version number in your gradle file back to the previous version that you were using or a version inbetween the one you're using and the latest.
The reason for this is wether the version number is e.g., compatible with your target SDK and/or if another library is dependent on the library your currently upgrading/downgrading.
Incompatibility issues like these can be quite common but unforseen since Android Studio don't always highlights this type of issues.

It's also a good idea to keep an eye on the documentation and release notes for the library that you are using.
These resources can provide valuable information about new features, deprecated APIs, and known issues that you may encounter while using the library.

In summary, if you encounter errors or deprecated code after upgrading a library in your gradle file, try to understand the problem and then work on a solution.
If necessary, you can also consider downgrading to an earlier version of the library or checking the documentation for more information.

Stay vigilant, and happy coding!
