In the Devies book club we recently finished Modern Software Engineering by David Farley.

In Modern Software Engineering, Farley want to reclaim the meaning of engineering in “software engineering”.
It’s not just about coding, it’s about doing what works to build better software faster - This involves processes, tools and culture.

The software industry is not like the manufacturing.
The process of building software can’t be reduced to a production line; it’s rather a process of exploration and discovery.
In this context, Farley suggests that there are two critical core competencies that software engineers must master: *learning* and *managing complexity*.

Science has proven to be a good approach to learning.
Throughout the book Farley relates to techniques and strategies from the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) and show how we can apply ideas from science to solve practical problems in our everyday work.

In this post, we'll share some takeaways from the book.

### Feedback loops

Feedback loops comes in many forms.
Compilation, unit tests and static code analysis provides feedback on your local development.
Continuous integration (CI) provides feedback on how well your change works together with other changes.
Continuous delivery (CD) provides feedback on how well your change works in production.
Metrics on how features are used provides feedback on how valuable your features are.

Regardless of what kind of feedback loop; the speed and quality of feedback constitutes your rate and quality of learning.
Be aware of your feedback loops and strive to improve them.

### Measuring success and improvement

It’s hard to measure success and improvement in software development.
Agile approaches accept that we have to trust subjective judgement by preferring “individuals and interactions over processes and tools”.
The four DevOps metrics related to stability and throughput are important - Gives us a less subjective measures that can reinforce our subjective evaluations.
