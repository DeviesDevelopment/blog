Tracer Bullets vs Prototypes
Two of the topics discussed in the book are tracer bullets and prototypes.
The concepts are similar but addresses different problems.
A prototype is a cheap way to try out an idea, to answer questions about something unknown.

Recently we finished <a href=https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/>The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition</a>.
In this post, we&rsquo;ll share learnings around some of the topics we have discussed.</p><h1 id=tracer-bullets-vs-prototypes>Tracer Bullets vs Prototypes</h1><p>Two of the topics discussed in the book are tracer bullets and prototypes.
The concepts are similar but addresses different problems.
A prototype is a cheap way to try out an idea, to answer questions about something unknown.
Details that are not required to answer the question are left out in favor of quick feedback at low cost.</p><p>Tracer bullets on the other hand is a tool to find out that an end-to-end solution is feasible.
The metaphor relates to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracer_ammunition>tracer ammunition</a>, which enables visual inspection of the trajectory of a bullet, even in the dark.
Real-time feedback under actual conditions.
In the context of a software project, the target is a final system which provides value.
The path to the target is often full of unknowns, and we might not have any idea of where to aim.
Your bullet (preferably a small but important feature) is fired under actual conditions (such as frontend, backend, persistence, testing, error handling).
You develop a skeleton, or a framework, which you can easily adjust and extend with additional features.
Code is not written in isolation, and it&rsquo;s not disposable.
If you miss the target - Learn, adjust and evaluate.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important that both team and stakeholders are aligned in what&rsquo;s being developed.
Are we building something quick and dirty to see if an idea flies, or are we building a working system with a limited set of features?
The answer to that question will probably impact both how you prioritize and how you implement features.</p><h1 id=purpose-of-testing>Purpose of Testing</h1><p>It is a common conception that the purpose of tests is to find bugs, to make sure that code works as intended.
In the book, it&rsquo;s stated that this is not the case - Instead, the benefits of tests occur while thinking about tests, and when you write them.
It&rsquo;s a tool to get rapid feedback about aspects of your code, e.g. clarity of the public API and coupling to other components.
Testing drives good software design.
In addition, a mature test suite will make your life way easier while refactoring.</p><p>In some projects, it may be argued that there&rsquo;s no time to write tests because feature development needs to be prioritized.
If we accept the fact that testing drives good design, and that good design makes us deliver faster in the long run; you should find a way to write tests anyway, preferably in parallel with the feature development.
<a href=https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-366>Friday Facts #366 - The only way to go fast, is to go well!</a> is a nice blog post about the relationship between software design and delivery speed.</p><h1 id=easy-to-change>Easy to Change</h1><p>As software developers, we often find ourselves working on projects that require frequent updates and changes.
Whether it&rsquo;s adding new features, fixing bugs, or adapting to changing requirements, the ability to make changes to our codebase quickly and easily is critical.
That&rsquo;s where the concept of an &ldquo;Easy to Change&rdquo; (ETC) mindset comes in.</p><p>The ETC mindset is all about designing software systems that are easy to modify and adapt as needed. This involves writing clean, readable, and well-structured code while
keeping an open mind to new technologies and approaches that can make our systems more flexible and adaptable.</p><p>As you implement a new feature, consider the long-term maintainability of your code. How easy or difficult would it be to adapt this feature to new requirements in the future? Will you need to make changes in multiple files, or can you make the necessary updates in just one file? Always think ETC.</p><h1 id=stone-soup--frog-soup>Stone Soup & Frog Soup</h1><p>In the fable about the stone soup, some soldiers start a soup with a few stones and slowly encourages the villagers to each donate an ingredient to make the soup tastier until they eventually rallied the whole village to produce a tasty soup.
You may be in a situation where you know what needs to be done and how to do it but if you ask for permission you&rsquo;ll be met with delays and skepticism. If you instead start small and develop it well you can start to get buy-in from stakeholders and team members. You say: &ldquo;Of course, it would be better if we added..&rdquo;. People find it easier to join an ongoing success.</p><p>This is similar to the fable about boiling a frog by slowly increasing the temperature. The main difference is that with the stone soup you&rsquo;re a catalyst for something good, while by progressively deceiving the frog you&rsquo;re doing it harm. It&rsquo;s important to reflect if you&rsquo;re making stone soup or frog soup.</p><h1 id=broken-window>Broken Window</h1><p>The &ldquo;Broken Window&rdquo; theory was introduced by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling in their article &ldquo;Broken Windows&rdquo; from 1982.
They argued that small signs of disorder and neglect in a neighbourhood, such as broken windows or graffiti, can lead to more serious crime and social problems.
The main idea is that if a broken window is left unrepaired, it sends a message that no one cares about the area.</p><p>In the context of software development, the &ldquo;Broken Window&rdquo; theory can be applied to the idea that small problems in our code can have a similar cascading effect.
If we allow small issues, such as code that is difficult to read or maintain, to go unaddressed, it can lead to larger problems in the future.
These larger problems can include increased difficulty in making changes to the code, a higher risk of introducing bugs, and decreased overall quality and reliability of the code.</p><p>There is really only one defense against the consequences of broken windows, and that is to fix the broken windows as soon as they are identified, or at least board them up!</p><h1 id=the-requirements-myth>The Requirements Myth</h1><p>I (Simon) used to be annoyed that clients or project owners didn&rsquo;t specify exactly what they wanted in the user stories. Did they not understand how much of our time they were wasting when we had to ask them to clarify everything?</p><p>As a pragmatic programmer you understand that no one knows exactly what they want and it&rsquo;s part of your job to help them understand it. By discussing the underlying problem and all the edge cases you will probably come up with something better than your client or you would come up with on your own.
This is why we work iteratively. We explore the problem space and every iteration we come a bit closer to a good (enough!) solution. Use mockups and prototypes to verify that you are solving the right problem. And when you&rsquo;re on the right track, always think ETC because the requirements may change sooner than you think.</p><h1 id=good-enough-software>Good-enough Software</h1><p>There is no such thing as perfect and bug-free code. While this fact is obvious to most of us, it is not uncommon for developers to attempt to make near perfect code by spending a large amount of time to design, test, and refine, only to then be told to release it as is to their dismay. In order for this fact to not bring the motivation down during development we developers should discipline ourselves to write software that&rsquo;s <em>good enough</em> - good enough for the users, for future maintainers of the code, and for our own peace of mind.</p><p>Note that the term <em>good enough</em> does <strong>not</strong> mean sloppy or badly produced code, it must still meet the users requirements and uphold certain standards in e.g. performance, security, and privacy. What the authors of this book are advocating for is to give the users an opportunity to participate in the decision of when the produced system is deemed good enough for their needs. While developers may be hesitant to release software with rough edges, many users prefer to have and use something <em>today</em> rather than having something &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; (or near it) six months or a year from now (when their needs will likely have changed anyway).</p><p>Another important point to understand is to know when to stop, i.e. having a clear definition of what <em>good enough</em> means for a particular project. Do not break a perfectly good program by spending too much time on overembellishment and overrefinement. There will come a time when you have to move on, and let the code be as it is. It will likely not be perfect, but then again, it can never be.</p><h1 id=dont-outrun-your-headlights>Don’t Outrun your Headlights</h1><p>Think of this scenario. You have worked on a feature for several weeks, everything is set up, the API is finished, you have put the final touches on the UI and it&rsquo;s time to show the customer/stakeholders what you have created. You&rsquo;re full of confidence, you have made your feature according to the designs and specifications provided. But the demo doesn&rsquo;t go well, the stakeholders want to change things or they are not happy with the feature and you slowly realise that most of the work that you have done for the last weeks have been for nothing. The API needs to be redesigned, the UI radically altered and the lines of code that needs to be removed are numbered in the hundreds.</p><p>If that scenarios sounds familiar to you then you might have outrun your headlights. In software development the headlights are as far as you can see in the future and that can be surprisingly short amount of time. Also if you drive too fast, something dangerous might show up in the headlights and you will not have time to adjust.</p><p>For a pragmatic programmer I (Jonatan) think two big learnings are that you should always take as small steps as possible and ask for feedback as often as possible so that if something does come up you can adjust accordingly and that you can never plan for all possible future events. Instead you should write code that you easily can replace.</p><p>But maybe the biggest take away for me is that if you ever find yourself in a situation such as above, instead of feeling frustrated and resentful, slow down your car and think of what you can do to spot the disaster before it happens the next time.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://blog.devies.se/>&copy; Devies Tech Culture Business Blog 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials><a href=https://www.instagram.com/deviesgbg/ target=_blank rel=noopener class="instagram ananke-social-link link-transition stackoverflow link dib z-999 pt3 pt0-l mr1" title="Instagram link" aria-label="follow on Instagram——Opens in a new window"><span class=icon><svg style="enable-background:new 0 0 67 67" viewBox="0 0 67 67" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M42.271 26.578v-.006c.502.0 1.005.01 1.508-.002.646-.017 1.172-.57 1.172-1.217.0-.963.0-1.927.0-2.89.0-.691-.547-1.24-1.236-1.241-.961.0-1.922-.001-2.883.0-.688.001-1.236.552-1.236 1.243-.001.955-.004 1.91.003 2.865.001.143.028.291.073.426.173.508.639.82 1.209.823C41.344 26.579 41.808 26.578 42.271 26.578zM33 27.817c-3.384-.002-6.135 2.721-6.182 6.089-.049 3.46 2.72 6.201 6.04 6.272 3.454.074 6.248-2.686 6.321-6.043C39.254 30.675 36.462 27.815 33 27.817zM21.046 31.116v.082c0 4.515-.001 9.03.0 13.545.0.649.562 1.208 1.212 1.208 7.16.001 14.319.001 21.479.0.656.0 1.215-.557 1.215-1.212.001-4.509.0-9.02.0-13.528v-.094H42.04c.411 1.313.537 2.651.376 4.014s-.601 2.631-1.316 3.803-1.644 2.145-2.779 2.918c-2.944 2.006-6.821 2.182-9.946.428-1.579-.885-2.819-2.12-3.685-3.713-1.289-2.373-1.495-4.865-.739-7.451C22.983 31.116 22.021 31.116 21.046 31.116zM45.205 49.255c.159-.026.318-.049.475-.083 1.246-.265 2.264-1.304 2.508-2.557.025-.137.045-.273.067-.409V21.794c-.021-.133-.04-.268-.065-.401-.268-1.367-1.396-2.428-2.78-2.618-.058-.007-.113-.02-.17-.03H20.761c-.147.027-.296.047-.441.08-1.352.308-2.352 1.396-2.545 2.766-.008.057-.02.114-.029.171V46.24c.028.154.05.311.085.465.299 1.322 1.427 2.347 2.77 2.52.064.008.13.021.195.03H45.205zM33 64C16.432 64 3 50.569 3 34S16.432 4 33 4s30 13.431 30 30S49.568 64 33 64z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd"/></svg>
