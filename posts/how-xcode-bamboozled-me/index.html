This struggle can be represented and reflected in many aspects of life, however as developers we encounter this dilemma more often than not.
This post is about how I fell into this dilemma and got bamboozled by Apple&rsquo;s integrated development environment, Xcode.</p><p>It&rsquo;s ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning and I&rsquo;ve just configured and bumped the dependencies for my client&rsquo;s android application which they hadn&rsquo;t touched for over two years.
Everything looked decent and worked properly.
I was now ready to further develop their iOS application which also hadn&rsquo;t been developed on since early 2020. While trying to compile the application, an error message prompted from a custom script saying:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-Swift data-lang=Swift><span style=display:flex><span>Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Reading this, my first instinct was to search this up on the browser.
I felt safe and relieved reading posts and threads about other developers who also had gotten the same error message thinking that this will be an easy fix.
Confidently I looked for possible solutions and made sure to take my time to understand what caused this error message before applying the solution.
This error message is shown when a dependecy is not updated and the most common solutions suggested:</p><ul><li>That you remove files such as Podfile.lock, the workspace file, and the Pod folder so that you reinstall them and do a clean folder build before compiling the application.</li><li>That you should log in to your KeyChain and lock & unlock the login button, clean build the project, and then re-compile the application.</li><li>To deintegrate the pod and pod files (the library dependency manager file and folder), to again later reinstall, clean the project via the command line, and then re-compile the application.</li></ul><p>All articles, blog posts, and videos I found mentioned either the solutions above or similar solutions.
Everything I tried didn&rsquo;t show any progress during the compilation of the application.
I was at the edge of closing down my browser and sending a slack post for guidance until I decided to re-read a thread from Apple&rsquo;s developer page.
There I read from a user who said:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-log data-lang=log>It seems like you have a Build Run Script in your Build Phases
that is failing. You might want to look at the build logs to see what is happening.
</code></pre><p>It was right there I realized that I did not only go too deep for a solution but I also got bamboozled by Xcode. The issue was never in the library dependency manager or using KeyChain access.
I was literally focusing on the main error message <code>Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code.</code> rather then <strong>looking closely</strong> at the rest of the log.
While looking at the rest of the log I found something really interesting:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-log data-lang=log>AttributeError: &#39;dict&#39; object has no attribute &#39;iteritems&#39;
dict_items object has no attribute &#39;sort&#39;
</code></pre><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-log data-lang=log>AttributeError: &#39;dict&#39; object has no attribute &#39;sort&#39;
</code></pre><p>If you&rsquo;re not a python enthusiast this won&rsquo;t say much other than that there is no method <code>iteritems()</code> and <code>sort()</code>, and as someone that has done some python coding, <code>iteritems()</code> and <code>sort()</code> are methods existing in python 2 but has been removed in python 3.
This meant that the script was using python 2 while Xcode was using python 3.
After a short research, numerous articles pointed out that Apple depricated python 2.7 for iOS development in early 2020 because python 2.7 was at its <a href=https://www.hexnode.com/blogs/apple-removing-python-2-7-on-mac-what-does-this-mean-for-it-admins/>end-cycle</a>.
Now it all makes sense!</p><p>To solve my issue, I changed <code>sort()</code> to the new corresponding method <code>sorted()</code> and same with <code>iteritems()</code> with <code>items()</code> on the custom script used during the compilation of my application.</p><h2 id=key-learnings>Key learnings:</h2><ul><li>While debugging an error, don&rsquo;t hesitate to take a <strong>good</strong> look at your log.
