I spent most of the time figuring out why a library did not accept my freshly generated RSA private key.
I was supposed to provide the RSA private key as an environment variable <code>RSA_PRIVATE_KEY</code>. I wanted to store the RSA private key in a file <code>private-key.pem</code> so my first attempt became <code>RSA_PRIVATE_KEY=\"$(cat private-key.pem)\" docker-compose up -d</code>, which failed due to decoding issues by the library.
It would appear that the library was very strict on the format of the private key.
After a lot of debugging, I managed to figure out how I was supposed to provide the private key and I will try to share my learnings here.</p></div><p class="f6 lh-copy mv0">By&nbsp;Fredrik Mile</p><a href=/posts/learn-the-tools-in-the-toolbox/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/how-xcode-bamboozled-me/ class="link black dim">How Xcode Bamboozled Me</a></h1><time class="f6 mv2 dib tracked" datetime=2022-09-01T16:49:22+02:00>September 1, 2022</time><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p>A common dilemma within the field of software development is traversing too deep within documentation to discover the solution to a bug.
This struggle can be represented and reflected in many aspects of life, however as developers we encounter this dilemma more often than not.

During some periods I haven&rsquo;t bothered, and that&rsquo;s OK.
I can always write a new entry tomorrow, or next week.</p><p>The diary can cover a lot of different aspects from your daily work.
Below are some examples.</p><ul><li>Things you&rsquo;ve learned</li><li>Accomplishments that you&rsquo;re proud of</li><li>Thoughts on dynamics within your team</li><li>Sketches of ideas</li><li>Reasoning behind technical decisions</li><li>Solutions to problems that you&rsquo;ve struggled with</li></ul><p>I think the greatest benefit of writing a diary is that you give yourself time to reflect on your daily work.
You will think about things that works less well and identify improvements for both yourself and your team.
Sometimes we feel that we&rsquo;re just standing still, not developing as individuals.
By reflecting on accomplishments and things you&rsquo;ve learned you can more clearly see that you&rsquo;re actually growing as an individual, every day.
You might reflect a lot already without writing anything about it.
That&rsquo;s great, but your brain might not be the most suitable storage solution in the long-term.
Additionally, when writing thoughts or solutions related to different problems, you&rsquo;ll get a personal knowledge base.
If you encounter the same issue again, you can always re-visit your old diary entries.</p></div><p class="f6 lh-copy mv0">By&nbsp;Rickard Andersson</p><a href=/posts/why-you-should-keep-a-developer-diary/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/zod-data-verification/ class="link black dim">Zod</a></h1><time class="f6 mv2 dib tracked" datetime=2022-08-24T14:02:31+02:00>August 24, 2022</time><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p><em><a href=#tldr>tl;dr</a></em></p><p>TypeScript is already a great upgrade from JavaScript if you like types and want to ensure type-safety in your code base.

In that project we use the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_notation>dental notation (ISO 3950)</a> to refer to teeth.
Every tooth have an unique identifier that consist of two characters.
The first character represent a quadrant (one of four areas in the mouth).
The second character is an identifier that refers to one of the eight teeth in that area.</p><p>Early on in the project we represented the tooth identifier using a string, for example <code>"42"</code> (4 is the quadrant, 2 is the identifier).
As the project grew we stared to use this tooth identifier in many different places in the project.
Since we use a raw string, we had to make sure the tooth identifier was properly validated at every place where it was used.
Additionally, it was unclear what the tooth identifier (string) represented, and it affected the readability of our code.</p></div><p class="f6 lh-copy mv0">By&nbsp;Carina Fernandes, Rickard Andersson, Johan Hage</p><a href=/posts/mitigating-primitive-obsession-in-asp.net-web-api/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/conventional-commits-and-generating-changelogs/ class="link black dim">Conventional Commits and Generating Changelogs</a></h1><time class="f6 mv2 dib tracked" datetime=2022-07-27T16:43:10+02:00>July 27, 2022</time><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p>Documentation, while in many cases important, might not be the first thing you as a developer want to spend time on doing.
Something you might do like as a developer is to spend a lot of time automating simple but tedious tasks in order to never have to do it manually again!
With documentation being a particularly important part in our project we were extra keen on finding as many ways of automating documentation as possible.

While upgrading our Nuget dependencies, we had some trouble with mismatching version numbers on transient dependencies. While we tried to upgrade the <code>IdentityModel</code> package to a newer version, <code>AccessTokenValidation</code> had a dependency to an older version. It turned out that <code>AccessTokenValidation</code> had been <a href=https://leastprivilege.com/2020/07/06/flexible-access-token-validation-in-asp-net-core/>deprecated</a> since we added it. This was solved by removing the dependency by simply substituting a call to <code>AddIdentityServerAuthentication</code> with a call to <code>AddJwtBearer</code>. We donâ€™t use Introspection to validate tokens in our solution, but it is possible to combine JwtBearer and Introspection using the <code>ForwardDefaultSelection</code> option.</p></div><p class="f6 lh-copy mv0">By&nbsp;Fredrik SjÃ¶holm</p><a href=/posts/.net-6-surprises/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/kubectl-wait-command/ class="link black dim">The kubectl wait Command</a></h1><time class="f6 mv2 dib tracked" datetime=2022-05-27T10:48:19+02:00>May 27, 2022</time><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p>Last week, while writing end-to-end tests for our Kubernetes application, we discovered a useful Kubernetes command.
