&lt;p>Over the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve delved into the art of writing a REST API using Rust.
Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;ve used the &lt;a href="https://crates.io/crates/axum">axum&lt;/a> crate to do so.
Like most projects, mine eventually needed authorization.
A way to validate incoming JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) from an external identity provider.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How We Chose to Implement Our Design System With Web Components</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/how-we-chose-to-implement-our-design-system-with-web-components/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 09:08:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/how-we-chose-to-implement-our-design-system-with-web-components/</guid><description>&lt;p>In case you missed my first post &lt;a href="https://blog.devies.se/posts/implementing-a-design-system-choosing-a-way-forward">&amp;ldquo;Implementing a design system&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, we chose to implement our design system with web components. This post will be about our thought process and the tradeoffs we considered when deciding on how we would implement with web components.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is possible to write a web component using only native JavaScript and HTML, but it is challenging. It is much more common to use a library like Lit or Stencil. The library helps with registration of the web component and change management as well as interoperability with popular frameworks.
In our case, in addition to Lit and Stencil, we also considered Mitosis, and compiling to web components with Solid or Angular.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Implementing a design system - Choosing a way forward</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/implementing-a-design-system-choosing-a-way-forward/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 10:08:51 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/implementing-a-design-system-choosing-a-way-forward/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the last year one of my main projects at work has been to lead the implementation of a design system, building it together with my team.

&lt;p>In Modern Software Engineering, Farley want to reclaim the meaning of engineering in “software engineering”.
It’s not just about coding, it’s about doing what works to build better software faster - This involves processes, tools and culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The software industry is not like the manufacturing.
The process of building software can’t be reduced to a production line; it’s rather a process of exploration and discovery.
In this context, Farley suggests that there are two critical core competencies that software engineers must master: &lt;em>learning&lt;/em> and &lt;em>managing complexity&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Structured Approach to Work With Software Development Tasks</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/a-structured-approach-to-work-with-software-development-tasks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 07:31:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/a-structured-approach-to-work-with-software-development-tasks/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sometimes I see people (myself included) working on software development tasks in a non-structured way.
You might have a vague understanding of what you&amp;rsquo;re about to accomplish.
Aimlessly traversing the code base, hoping to find places that you might need to change.
You instantly start to chase new ideas, while forgetting about prior (and possibly important) ideas.
It might be hard to determine when you&amp;rsquo;re done.
You might not commit intermediary working states, and have a hard time finding what you&amp;rsquo;ve messed up once something is broken.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating a Postman Collection From Swagger</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/creating-a-postman-collection-from-swagger/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 13:20:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/creating-a-postman-collection-from-swagger/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="background">Background&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This is probably not news to anyone that has been working as developer consultant.
Large existing code base; in our case it&amp;rsquo;s an application that has existed for about 2,5 years and during that time it has developed
several services and therefore has many endpoints.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore when me and my colleagues had to start developing new features it was hard to know what was available and what wasn&amp;rsquo;t with over 50 different endpoints to hit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Xcode 14 &amp; SPM: Deployment Pipeline in Azure</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/xcode-14-manual-signing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 08:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/xcode-14-manual-signing/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;a href="#tldr">tl;dr&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines are great tools to automate the deployment process of a software. Their main objective is to minimise human error and maintain a consistent process for how the software is released.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Xcode projects this becomes a time critical process once the project has to be built for different configurations and/or environments. Since every configuration might require a different signing method, or even different deployment platform.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learnings From The Pragmatic Programmer</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/learnings-from-pragmatic-programmer-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 12:44:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/learnings-from-pragmatic-programmer-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>At Devies we run a book club where we on a weekly basis discuss topics from a book that we are reading in a common pace.

&lt;p>Upgrading libraries in your gradle file for an Android project is a crucial part of keeping your project up to date and running smoothly.
However, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to encounter errors or deprecated code after upgrading a library. If this happens to you, don&amp;rsquo;t panic!
There are a few steps you can take to fix the issues and get your project back on track.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="understanding-the-role-of-gradle-files">Understanding the Role of Gradle Files&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In an Android project, there are two main gradle build files that you might need to work with: the &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;build.gradle&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> file and the &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;gradle-wrapper.properties&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Take Advantage of the Tools in the Toolbox</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/learn-the-tools-in-the-toolbox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 08:25:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/learn-the-tools-in-the-toolbox/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I ended up spending more time than I expected on debugging.
I spent most of the time figuring out why a library did not accept my freshly generated RSA private key.
I was supposed to provide the RSA private key as an environment variable &lt;code>RSA_PRIVATE_KEY&lt;/code>. I wanted to store the RSA private key in a file &lt;code>private-key.pem&lt;/code> so my first attempt became &lt;code>RSA_PRIVATE_KEY=\&amp;quot;$(cat private-key.pem)\&amp;quot; docker-compose up -d&lt;/code>, which failed due to decoding issues by the library.
It would appear that the library was very strict on the format of the private key.
After a lot of debugging, I managed to figure out how I was supposed to provide the private key and I will try to share my learnings here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Xcode Bamboozled Me</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/how-xcode-bamboozled-me/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 16:49:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/how-xcode-bamboozled-me/</guid><description>&lt;p>A common dilemma within the field of software development is traversing too deep within documentation to discover the solution to a bug.
This struggle can be represented and reflected in many aspects of life, however as developers we encounter this dilemma more often than not.
This post is about how I fell into this dilemma and got bamboozled by Apple&amp;rsquo;s integrated development environment, Xcode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s ten o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning and I&amp;rsquo;ve just configured and bumped the dependencies for my client&amp;rsquo;s android application which they hadn&amp;rsquo;t touched for over two years.

&lt;p>Personally I&amp;rsquo;ve kept one for about a year now, and I&amp;rsquo;m very content.
During some periods I haven&amp;rsquo;t bothered, and that&amp;rsquo;s OK.
I can always write a new entry tomorrow, or next week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The diary can cover a lot of different aspects from your daily work.
Below are some examples.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Things you&amp;rsquo;ve learned&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accomplishments that you&amp;rsquo;re proud of&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thoughts on dynamics within your team&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sketches of ideas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reasoning behind technical decisions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Solutions to problems that you&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I think the greatest benefit of writing a diary is that you give yourself time to reflect on your daily work.
You will think about things that works less well and identify improvements for both yourself and your team.
Sometimes we feel that we&amp;rsquo;re just standing still, not developing as individuals.
By reflecting on accomplishments and things you&amp;rsquo;ve learned you can more clearly see that you&amp;rsquo;re actually growing as an individual, every day.
You might reflect a lot already without writing anything about it.
That&amp;rsquo;s great, but your brain might not be the most suitable storage solution in the long-term.
Additionally, when writing thoughts or solutions related to different problems, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a personal knowledge base.
If you encounter the same issue again, you can always re-visit your old diary entries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zod</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/zod-data-verification/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 14:02:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/zod-data-verification/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;a href="#tldr">tl;dr&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TypeScript is already a great upgrade from JavaScript if you like types and want to ensure type-safety in your code base.
Zod aids that goal by making sure that incoming data satisfies the purpose it is about to fulfill, among other features of course.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://github.com/colinhacks/zod/raw/master/logo.svg" alt="zod logo" height="150px"/>
&lt;p>Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library with lots of features that I have yet to use.
However, the basics are very handy and simple to get started with!
For the purpose of introducing Zod, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume that we have a Node.js backend with an endpoint for adding a user to our system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Integration Test Api in .Net Using Reflection</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/integration-test-api-controller-in-.net-using-reflection/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 09:07:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/integration-test-api-controller-in-.net-using-reflection/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are a few different approaches to testing in the spectrum between simple unit tests and complete E2E tests. If I had to choose one approach to prioritize I would pick integration tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key reasons are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tests a flow of multiple functions, in contrast with unit tests where only a single function is tested&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self contained i.e. the test has no external dependencies on a deployed environment etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Makes logical sense to test a complete function in a REST api, a single Lambda in AWS or an Azure function&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my case the goal was to setup a test suite for a .NET web api. I quickly realized that the naive way to explicitly instantiate every controller plus all dependencies would lead
to lots of repeated boilerplate code in order to setup a test case. I also wanted to make use of the existing &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-6.0">DI&lt;/a> configuration.&lt;br>
So how to create a generic setup where new test cases is a breeze to create? 🤔&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mitigating Primitive Obsession in ASP.NET Web Api</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/mitigating-primitive-obsession-in-asp.net-web-api/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 15:43:58 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/mitigating-primitive-obsession-in-asp.net-web-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the projects we work with at Devies is related to the dental domain.
In that project we use the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_notation">dental notation (ISO 3950)&lt;/a> to refer to teeth.
Every tooth have an unique identifier that consist of two characters.
The first character represent a quadrant (one of four areas in the mouth).
The second character is an identifier that refers to one of the eight teeth in that area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Early on in the project we represented the tooth identifier using a string, for example &lt;code>&amp;quot;42&amp;quot;&lt;/code> (4 is the quadrant, 2 is the identifier).
As the project grew we stared to use this tooth identifier in many different places in the project.
Since we use a raw string, we had to make sure the tooth identifier was properly validated at every place where it was used.
Additionally, it was unclear what the tooth identifier (string) represented, and it affected the readability of our code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conventional Commits and Generating Changelogs</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/conventional-commits-and-generating-changelogs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2022 16:43:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/conventional-commits-and-generating-changelogs/</guid><description>&lt;p>Documentation, while in many cases important, might not be the first thing you as a developer want to spend time on doing.
Something you might do like as a developer is to spend a lot of time automating simple but tedious tasks in order to never have to do it manually again!
With documentation being a particularly important part in our project we were extra keen on finding as many ways of automating documentation as possible.
In this post I will go through how we utilized &lt;code>Conventional Commits&lt;/code>, an Azure Devops extension called &lt;code>Commitizen&lt;/code> and an npm package called &lt;code>Standard version&lt;/code> to automatically generate changelogs in our Azure Devops CI environment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>.NET 6 Surprises</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/.net-6-surprises/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 09:15:58 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/.net-6-surprises/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few weeks ago, we upgraded one of our projects from .NET 5 to .NET 6, since .NET 5 was nearing end of support. In this process, we ran into a few hurdles. This post will go through a few of them that were a bit unexpected, and why we ran into them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="accesstokenvalidation-deprecated">AccessTokenValidation deprecated&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t completely related to .NET 6 in itself, but we ran into the issue during the upgrade. While upgrading our Nuget dependencies, we had some trouble with mismatching version numbers on transient dependencies. While we tried to upgrade the &lt;code>IdentityModel&lt;/code> package to a newer version, &lt;code>AccessTokenValidation&lt;/code> had a dependency to an older version. It turned out that &lt;code>AccessTokenValidation&lt;/code> had been &lt;a href="https://leastprivilege.com/2020/07/06/flexible-access-token-validation-in-asp-net-core/">deprecated&lt;/a> since we added it. This was solved by removing the dependency by simply substituting a call to &lt;code>AddIdentityServerAuthentication&lt;/code> with a call to &lt;code>AddJwtBearer&lt;/code>. We don’t use Introspection to validate tokens in our solution, but it is possible to combine JwtBearer and Introspection using the &lt;code>ForwardDefaultSelection&lt;/code> option.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The kubectl wait Command</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/kubectl-wait-command/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 10:48:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/kubectl-wait-command/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week, while writing end-to-end tests for our Kubernetes application, we discovered a useful Kubernetes command. Namely, the &lt;code>kubectl wait&lt;/code> command. We managed to stabilize our test using this command, and we will explain how we did it in this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have written our end-to-end tests in bash, and they deploy and manage different Kubernetes resources. Bash scripts execute commands sequentially, waiting for the first to finish before executing the next one.

&lt;p>We are currently working on a project where we have an nginx instance that is redirecting traffic for many different domains.

Additionally, we&amp;rsquo;ve added pipelines in Azure as an attempt to achieve &lt;span style="font-family:Arial;color:#00c0ff;">MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY&lt;/span> when it comes to deployment and integration. So there we are. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely morning. The sun is shining, the coffee is warm, and we&amp;rsquo;re ready to drop some lines of code! 😎&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week we built and deployed a version of our React app that had a slightly faulty CSS attribute that made the header of the app take up the whole screen. Thus our first and foremost task was to fix it so that it only takes up a small area at the top of the screen. We used the Inspection feature in Firefox Developer Edition to pinpoint the faulty CSS and determine the issue, which we managed to do. The next step was to apply that fix in our code to see what would happen. The fix worked locally by running the React app using &lt;code>yarn start&lt;/code> as well as deploying a Docker image. Great, the fix is ready to be deployed using our Azure pipelines!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why you should add a cypress test to your CI/CD pipeline</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/why-you-should-add-a-cypress-test-to-your-ci-cd-pipeline/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 08:29:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/why-you-should-add-a-cypress-test-to-your-ci-cd-pipeline/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cypress is a framework for testing web applications, primarily used for end-to-end testing.

You don&amp;rsquo;t want to realize after a few hours of work that you worked on the wrong branch and have a few messy merges and rebases in front of you. Of course, the easiest way to show the current branch is to run &lt;code>git status&lt;/code> but that requires an action from you, Instead, I recommend you to include the git branch as part of your prompt string. The prompt string is the string that marks your command line and is set by the shell variable &lt;code>PS1&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introducing Workflow Timer</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/introducing-workflow-timer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 10:08:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/introducing-workflow-timer/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/DeviesDevelopment/workflow-timer">Workflow-timer&lt;/a> is a Github action that measures the duration of the workflow and compares it to historical runs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The purpose of this action is to make the developer aware of when feedbacks loops get longer. Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you are running unit tests as part of your current workflow. If merging your changes (your PR) would increase the time it takes to run the unit tests by 50%, your changes probably have unwanted side effects. It&amp;rsquo;s about creating awareness for the developer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using managed identities and role based access control is great!</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/managed-identities-and-rbac-is-great/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 20:15:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/managed-identities-and-rbac-is-great/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a project I work with we use &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview">Azure App Service&lt;/a> for hosting an ASP.NET application. All external configuration used by the application is stored in an &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview">Azure App Configuration&lt;/a> store. I recently updated how the application authenticates toward the App Configuration store and think it worked out pretty well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Prior to the change we used connection strings (i.e. a string containing endpoint, username and password) for authentication. The main drawback with this is that we have to manage the credentials ourselves. We must provide the connection string to the application in some way (e.g. set it in a CI/CD pipeline after deploying our application). If our connection string is compromised, we must regenerate it and make sure that the application is provided with the new one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Long feedback loops invite for context switching</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/2022-02-22-long-feedback-loops-invite-for-context-switching/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 10:08:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/2022-02-22-long-feedback-loops-invite-for-context-switching/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a backend developer, there is especially one thing that I’m jealous of when it comes to frontend development. The short feedback loop, namely, the time and effort it takes to get feedback for your changes. Enable hot or live reloading while developing, and the results of your changes will be in front of you instantly, which is super nice. This is how it should be, even when you are developing the backend, infrastructure, CI/CD, or whatever. A long feedback loop can have a lot of hidden consequences, and it makes you ineffective. You and your team should spend time making sure that your feedback loop is short, and kept short.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introducing Frontman</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/introducing-frontman/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jan 2022 10:08:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/introducing-frontman/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/DeviesDevelopment/frontman">Frontman&lt;/a> is a very light-weight NGINX reverse proxy that is deployed using Docker. Its purpose is to act as the entry point to your server. It will redirect incoming traffic to one out of many Docker-based applications running on the same server, based on the hostname in the incoming request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rationale behind this is that it enables you to host as many services as you want on the same server, while still only keeping ports 80 and 443 open to the outside world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How I've automated the setup of my virtual server</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/automated-ec2-setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 05:57:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/automated-ec2-setup/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a good way of hosting some personal projects. I wanted something relatively cheap which I could use to host multiple services. A colleague of mine have for a long time used a single virtual server (more specifically, an EC2 instance in AWS) where he runs multiple services inside docker containers. To enable access to each individual service, there&amp;rsquo;s a NGINX reverse proxy that forwards traffic to services. I decided to try the same approach.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trying out AWS Timestream</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/aws-timestream/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 15:50:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/aws-timestream/</guid><description>&lt;p>AWS recently (last year) released their new server-less database focused purely on time series data, Amazon Timestream. On their product page, AWS describes the database like:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, and serverless time series database service for IoT and operational applications that makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of events per day up to 1,000 times faster and at as little as 1/10th the cost of relational databases.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Minimize Java Lambda Cold Start Times</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/implementation/aws/2021/04/08/minimize-java-lambda-coldstarts.html/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 09:25:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/implementation/aws/2021/04/08/minimize-java-lambda-coldstarts.html/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have ever run Java inside a lambda function on AWS, you will have noticed the quite significant cold start times that comes with spinning up the JVM environment. In this post, I will discuss some different tricks you can use to minimize these cold start times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with cold starts arises when there are no &amp;ldquo;warm&amp;rdquo; lambda available to handle an incoming request, which usually happens whenever an endpoint experiences a large and sudden spike in traffic. The most commonly occurring scenario when this happens is probably when an endpoint goes from no traffic at all in a while (and thus having no warm lambdas ready) to suddenly having one or more incoming requests to serve.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrating data between DynamoDB tables</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/2021-03-30-dynamodb-migrations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 10:34:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/2021-03-30-dynamodb-migrations/</guid><description>&lt;p>When setting up a new DynamoDB table, an important decision is to decide what primary key to use. However, it’s not uncommon to not have the full picture up front and therefore it could be hard to make the right decision beforehand. While the &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-general-nosql-design.html">official AWS documentation&lt;/a> states that &lt;em>“you shouldn’t start designing your schema for DynamoDB until you know the questions it will need to answer”&lt;/em>, you often need to experiment to be able to discover what those questions are. Luckily there is an easy approach for how to migrate to a new key schema that we will describe in this blog post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Analytics without third-party tools</title><link>https://blog.devies.se/posts/2020-09-01-analytics-poc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devies.se/posts/2020-09-01-analytics-poc/</guid><description>&lt;p>Finding out how much traffic your site has and how your users interact with it is always crucial. Such information will enable you to scale your backend properly, fine-tune the user experience and weed out unused features. Some even go so far as claiming that data is the &amp;ldquo;gold of our time&amp;rdquo;. Regardless of the truth of that claim, few can dispute the usefulness of user analytics data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The go-to solution for most developers is to use Google Analytics (in fact used by &lt;a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ta-googleanalytics">55% of all websites&lt;/a>) or some other third party framework. Although this can surely be a valid choice and a quick way forward, using a third party tool to handle user analytics data raises some concerns. First of all, you give away data about how your product is being used for free (or perhaps you even pay for it!). And more importantly, it makes it harder for you to guarantee that potentially sensitive user data is handled in an anonymous and secure way. The best way to guarantee that your data is in safe hands is to let as few hands as possible get in touch with the data.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
