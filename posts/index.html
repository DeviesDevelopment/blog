Background Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines are great tools to automate the deployment process of a software. Their main objective is to minimise human error and maintain a consistent process for how the software is released.
For Xcode projects this becomes a time critical process once the project has to be built for different configurations and/or environments. Since every configuration might require a different signing method, or even different deployment platform.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/learnings-from-pragmatic-programmer-1/ class="link black dim">Learnings From The Pragmatic Programmer</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">At Devies we run a book club where we on a weekly basis discuss topics from a book that we are reading in a common pace.

Tracer Bullets vs Prototypes Two of the topics discussed in the book are tracer bullets and prototypes.

Upgrading libraries in your gradle file for an Android project is a crucial part of keeping your project up to date and running smoothly. However, it&rsquo;s not uncommon to encounter errors or deprecated code after upgrading a library. If this happens to you, don&rsquo;t panic! There are a few steps you can take to fix the issues and get your project back on track.
Understanding the Role of Gradle Files In an Android project, there are two main gradle build files that you might need to work with: the &ldquo;build.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/learn-the-tools-in-the-toolbox/ class="link black dim">Take Advantage of the Tools in the Toolbox</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Last week I ended up spending more time than I expected on debugging. I spent most of the time figuring out why a library did not accept my freshly generated RSA private key. I was supposed to provide the RSA private key as an environment variable RSA_PRIVATE_KEY. I wanted to store the RSA private key in a file private-key.pem so my first attempt became RSA_PRIVATE_KEY=\"$(cat private-key.pem)\" docker-compose up -d, which failed due to decoding issues by the library.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/how-xcode-bamboozled-me/ class="link black dim">How Xcode Bamboozled Me</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A common dilemma within the field of software development is traversing too deep within documentation to discover the solution to a bug. This struggle can be represented and reflected in many aspects of life, however as developers we encounter this dilemma more often than not. This post is about how I fell into this dilemma and got bamboozled by Apple&rsquo;s integrated development environment, Xcode.
It&rsquo;s ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning and I&rsquo;ve just configured and bumped the dependencies for my client&rsquo;s android application which they hadn&rsquo;t touched for over two years.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/why-you-should-keep-a-developer-diary/ class="link black dim">Why You Should Keep a Developer Diary</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Every software developer should keep a diary.
Personally I&rsquo;ve kept one for about a year now, and I&rsquo;m very content. During some periods I haven&rsquo;t bothered, and that&rsquo;s OK. I can always write a new entry tomorrow, or next week.
The diary can cover a lot of different aspects from your daily work. Below are some examples.
Things you&rsquo;ve learned Accomplishments that you&rsquo;re proud of Thoughts on dynamics within your team Sketches of ideas Reasoning behind technical decisions Solutions to problems that you&rsquo;ve struggled with I think the greatest benefit of writing a diary is that you give yourself time to reflect on your daily work.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/zod-data-verification/ class="link black dim">Zod</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">tl;dr
TypeScript is already a great upgrade from JavaScript if you like types and want to ensure type-safety in your code base. Zod aids that goal by making sure that incoming data satisfies the purpose it is about to fulfill, among other features of course.
Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library with lots of features that I have yet to use. However, the basics are very handy and simple to get started with!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/integration-test-api-controller-in-.net-using-reflection/ class="link black dim">Integration Test Api in .Net Using Reflection</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">There are a few different approaches to testing in the spectrum between simple unit tests and complete E2E tests. If I had to choose one approach to prioritize I would pick integration tests.
The key reasons are:
Tests a flow of multiple functions, in contrast with unit tests where only a single function is tested Self contained i.e. the test has no external dependencies on a deployed environment etc. Makes logical sense to test a complete function in a REST api, a single Lambda in AWS or an Azure function The problem In my case the goal was to setup a test suite for a .</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/posts/mitigating-primitive-obsession-in-asp.net-web-api/ class="link black dim">Mitigating Primitive Obsession in ASP.NET Web Api</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">One of the projects we work with at Devies is related to the dental domain.
